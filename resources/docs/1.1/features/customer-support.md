## Setup Guest Mode

**Guest Mode** is `disabled` by default. You need to set it up first to `enable` it. But before that, it is required to set up and `enable` **User Groups**

---

>{info} Read the **[User Groups](/{{route}}/{{version}}/features/user-groups)** feature before continuing to below steps.

---

It's very simple to `enable` the **Guest Mode**, you only need to -

1. Go to `config/addchat.php` file and scroll to `Guest Mode` section
2. Add `guest_group_id`. The group who can chat with guests. Although, Admin group can chat with Guests by default.


>{success} After the above step completes, `Admin` & `Guest-group` users can see a **Guest/Customer Support** tab on the chat widget.

## Guest Login

Let's see how a Guest can start chatting without logging into the website.

![Guest login](https://addchat-laravel-pro-docs.classiebit.com/images/start-guest-chat.jpg "Guest login")

---

1. When a Guest visits your website and clicks on the AddChat widget.

2. A form window will open in the AddChat widget, asking about their `Name` & `Email`.

3. After submitting, the Guest can start chatting.


>{primary} When Guest sends a message, it gets forwarded to all the Guest-group users.

<a name="Auto-conversion"></a>
## Auto-conversion

AddChat auto-convert the Guest conversations to Registered user conversations, when the Guest **Register** on the website with the same `Email` that he/she used as a Guest. Let's see what it is-


- Suppose a Guest started chatting.

- And on next day, when the guest returns and opens the chat, then he/she can continue from the previous conversation.

- Now suppose the same guest **Signup** on the website with the same `email`

- And, when the guest **Login** into the website, and open the Chat widget, then he/she can see all the previous conversations that were sent as **Guest**.


>{primary} This is useful when your leads become your customers.
