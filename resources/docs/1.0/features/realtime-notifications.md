**Internal** notification is a custom real-time notification system built using VueJs, which does not require any additional server setup. It works smoothly behind the scenes.

<br>

**Internal** notification system sends regular `Asynchronous HTTP/S Requests` to the server for getting the latest messages on the fly. For the geeks who wanna know more, it only runs a **single `SELECT`** database query in a **single `Table`** to fetch the latest messages.

>{info} The **total no. of `records`** fetched from **single `SELECT`** query are equal to the **total no. of users chatting simultaneously**.

---

>{primary} Admin can switch between **Pusher** & **Internal** notification system with just one click.
